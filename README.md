# PianoGPT: A Generative Transformer for Symbolic Music


PianoGPT is a custom-built, decoder-only Transformer designed to generate coherent musical compositions. By leveraging the **REMI (Revamped MIDI)** tokenization scheme and a multi-head self-attention architecture, the model learns the long-range dependencies of melody, harmony, and rhythm.

## 🚀 Features

* **Causal Self-Attention:** Implements a 4-head attention mechanism with a causal mask to ensure temporal integrity.
* **REMI Tokenization:** Supports velocity, tempo, and chord changes, moving beyond simple pitch-based generation.
* **Residual Architecture:** Utilizes skip-connections and Layer Normalization for stable training of deep neural networks.
* **Scalable Design:** Configurable embedding dimensions and block sizes to balance performance and computational efficiency.

You can find pre-generated samples in the /samples directory. These were generated by a model trained on the MAESTRO Dataset (Piano solo).

##📈 Methodology
This project implements the Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism from the seminal "Attention Is All You Need" paper. The model was optimized using cross-entropy loss to predict the next token in a sequence, effectively learning the underlying probability distribution of musical structures.

By representing musical events as discrete tokens (REMI), we transform the composition task into a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem, allowing the Transformer to capture both local harmonic patterns and global structural consistency.
